# Minesweeper
An implementation of the classic Minesweeper game in Java using JavaFX. This project was created as part of the 2022-2023 Multimedia Technology course from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).

## Features
- All the standard gameplay features of Minesweeper you've come to expect
- A countdown timer to keep track of time spent
- Two difficulty levels to choose from
- A "hypermine" that can reveal all mine in the same column/row if marked within the first moves.
- Create your own scenarios with customizable options!
- View the results of your previous rounds
- And much mor- actually, that's about it.

## Language & Libraries
- The whole project uses the Java programming language. I targeted Java SE 17, but the project can probably be run on older versions as well
- Minesweeper utilizes the JavaFX framework to build the user interface. JavaFX uses FXML files created by me in Gluon Scene Builder
